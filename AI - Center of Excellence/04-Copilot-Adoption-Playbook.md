# GitHub Copilot Adoption Playbook

A practical starter guide for rolling out GitHub Copilot in your organization.

---

## 1. Suggested Use Cases

Start with high-value, low-risk use cases to build confidence and demonstrate ROI.

### Tier 1 — Start Here (Low Risk)
- **Code completion**: Autocomplete for boilerplate, repetitive patterns, and standard implementations
- **Test generation**: Scaffold unit tests from existing code
- **Documentation**: Generate docstrings, README content, and inline comments
- **Code explanation**: Understand unfamiliar codebases faster
- **CLI assistance**: Use Copilot CLI for shell commands and git operations

### Tier 2 — Expand (Medium Risk)
- **Code review**: AI-assisted PR review for bugs, security, and style
- **Refactoring**: Suggest improvements to existing code
- **Migration assistance**: Help with language/framework upgrades
- **Architecture exploration**: Use chat to explore design options

### Tier 3 — Advanced (Requires Governance Review)
- **Coding agents**: Autonomous multi-step code changes
- **Custom instructions**: Organization-specific prompts and rules
- **MCP integrations**: Connect Copilot to your organization's tools and data sources

## 2. Guardrails

### Technical Guardrails
- Enable content exclusions for sensitive repositories
- Configure Copilot policies at the organization level
- Use IP indemnity features (GitHub Copilot Business/Enterprise)
- Block suggestions matching public code (if required by policy)
- Review [firewall and network requirements](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/responsible-use/agents)

### Process Guardrails
- All AI-generated code must pass the same review standards as human-written code
- Developers remain accountable for code they commit, regardless of source
- Sensitive repositories can opt out of Copilot via org policy
- High-risk use cases require Governance Board approval (see [Governance Checklist](./03-Governance-Checklist.md))

### Data Guardrails
- No secrets or credentials in prompts
- Understand what data is sent to the service ([Trust Center](https://copilot.github.trust.page/))
- Confidential/restricted data should not be used in prompts without approval

---

## 3. Training Plan

### Phase 1: Awareness (Week 1–2)
- Announce the rollout and share this playbook
- Host a 30-minute intro session (what Copilot does, what it doesn't)
- Share the [GitHub Copilot docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)

### Phase 2: Hands-On (Week 3–4)
- Run a workshop: "Your first hour with Copilot"
- Provide a cheat sheet of effective prompts
- Set up a Slack/Teams channel for tips and questions

### Phase 3: Deepening (Month 2+)
- Office hours (bi-weekly, 30 min)
- Share team success stories and patterns
- Introduce advanced features (agents, custom instructions, CLI)
- Pair champions with teams that have not adopted yet

### Training Resources
- [GitHub Copilot Chat – Responsible Use](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/responsible-use/chat)
- [GitHub Copilot Agents – Responsible Use](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/responsible-use/agents)
- Shared prompt library *(create and maintain in a shared repo)*

---

## 4. Feedback Loops

### Continuous Feedback
- **Channel**: Dedicated Slack/Teams channel for questions, tips, and issues
- **Surveys**: Monthly pulse survey (3 questions: usefulness, friction, suggestions)
- **Metrics**: Track via [Copilot Metrics API](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/rolling-out-github-copilot-at-scale/analyzing-usage-over-time)

### Key Metrics to Track
| Metric | Source | Cadence |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Active users / seats | Copilot admin dashboard | Weekly |
| Acceptance rate | Copilot Metrics API | Weekly |
| Lines suggested vs. accepted | Copilot Metrics API | Monthly |
| Developer satisfaction | Survey | Monthly |
| Time saved (self-reported) | Survey | Quarterly |
| Incidents / policy violations | Incident tracker | Ongoing |

### Review Cycle
- **Monthly**: Your AICOE reviews metrics and feedback, then adjusts training
- **Quarterly**: Report to leadership on adoption, value, and next steps

## 5. Rollout Timeline

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Announce, assign seats to pilot group (10–20 developers) |
| 2 | Intro session + share playbook and guardrails |
| 3–4 | Hands-on workshops, open channel for support |
| 5–8 | Pilot runs, collect feedback, iterate on guardrails |
| 9–10 | Review pilot results, present to leadership |
| 11+ | Expand to broader organization in waves |
